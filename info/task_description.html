        ... If I let my fingers wander idly over the keys of a typewriter it might happen that my screed made an
        intelligible sentence. If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters they might write all the books in the
        British Museum. The chance of their doing so is decidedly more favourable than the chance of the molecules
        returning to one half of the vessel.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">The infinite monkey theorem</a>
states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard
for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text,
such as the complete works of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis">John Wallis</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Let's suppose our robo-monkey are typing, typing and typing.
    And now we have a lot various short texts.
    Let's try to check them for sensible word inclusions.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a short text and sensible words.
    You should count how many words are included in the given text.
    A word should be solid and can be a part of other word.
    Text letter case does not matter. Words are given in lowercase and don't repeat.
    If a word appear several times in the text, then count it only once.
</p>


<p>
    For example,
    text - "<em>How</em> <em>are</em>sjfhdskfhskd <em>you</em>?", words - ("how", "are", "you", "hello").
    The result will be 3.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments.
    A text as a string (unicode for py2) and words as a set of strings (unicode for py2).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The number of words in the text as an integer.
</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
count_words("How aresjfhdskfhskd you?", {"how", "are", "you", "hello"}) == 3
count_words("Bananas, give me bananas!!!", {"banana", "bananas"}) == 2
count_words("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.",
            {"sum", "hamlet", "infinity", "anything"}) == 1

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Python is useful and powerful language for text processing.
    This is a simple example of the text searching tool.
